### Redux-Road
- This project is about an adventure game, which uses reducers, state, and actions. The state will represent, the state of the game. 
- It contains the player’s inventory, distance travelled, and time on the road. 
- Each event in the game is represented as an action. 
- Players can gather supplies, travel, and if they play risky sometimes they tip over the wagon carrying their supplies.
